GTI makes it easy to search for genes across multiple institution gene panels.

## Features

- Single page application (SPA). Entirely static. Can be deployed in minutes on any web server. No database, no config files.
- Extremely fast: search thousands of genes in dozens of panels in a few seconds.
- Open Source and transparent: all technologies used are free and the underlying data (gene definitions, panels, bed files, etc.) is public.
- Customizable: create your own panels for a quick test or use the provided tools to deploy your own site with your own data.

GTI was developed for the GOAL consortium by Riyaz Shaik (UF) and Guillaume Jimenez (UTSW)
